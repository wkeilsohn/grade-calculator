# grade-calculator
Calculates grades based on a hypothetical number of students and tests.

Please run the "Central_HW2_2019.py" file. It will call the other files in the directory to run as need be. The 'data.txt' file is a randomly generated file that is re-written every time the user selects for random data. The the 'made_data.txt' file is the file that was constructed based on the specifications of the assignment (10x7). The two other files deal with reading and writing data files and thus cover the tasks asked in terms of calculating the average, rounding up, and producing a dictionary. Note: There are two places (on two files) where the path to the directory must be replaced in order to run.
